# WizardMap
A Java project that simulates a grid navigation system, where tasks are completed by navigating through nodes, avoiding obstacles, and using custom wizard options. The project utilizes handcrafted data structures to handle grid representation, pathfinding, and mission objectives. Features Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm for efficient route calculation.
